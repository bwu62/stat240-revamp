One of the first and most important things you should do after obtaining a dataset is to **explore the data thoroughly** using a combination of summary statistics and visualizations. Careful data exploration will help you do the following:

 1. Understand the dataset,
 2. Discover interesting, sometimes unexpected patterns and trends,
 3. Identify potential sources of problems (e.g. errors, biases, other obstacles to later analysis),
 4. Formulate meaningful questions to ask using the data, and
 5. Choose the most appropriate path of analysis.

In this chapter, we will cover a variety of data exploration techniques, starting with descriptive (i.e. summary) statistics, then move on to data visualization (i.e. graphing/plotting).




## Descriptive statistics


Descriptive statistics is what most people think of when they hear the word "statistics", i.e. a collection of numbers that summarize some data. This is often a good starting point for exploring a newly encountered dataset.

:::{.def}
A **statistic** is just some number computed from a sample of data, often intended to summarize the data in a specific way. Virtually any function that ingests a sample and outputs a number can be referred to as a statistic.

### Measures of central tendency

There are MANY statistics that quantify the "center" of some sample. These are all collectively referred to as **measures of central tendency**, also often called **averages** for short. The 3 most common averages are the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.

:::{.note}
**"Average" can refer to ANY measure of central tendency**, i.e. average can refer to either mean, median, or mode (or any of these [other measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency#Measures)). Thus, it's generally recommended to specify which measure you're referring to and avoid using the word "average" (unless you're being strategically ambiguous).
