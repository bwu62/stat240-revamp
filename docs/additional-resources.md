# Additional Resources

Here's a page with additional loosely organized resources that you may find useful.

- Harvard's online R programming course: <https://cs50.harvard.edu/r/2024> which has more info on general R programming like conditionals, loops, functions etc.

- R-charts: <https://r-charts.com> which has a fairly comprehensive list of plots in both base R and ggplot2, with great code examples.

- R-statistics.co: <https://r-statistics.co> which has great tutorials on everything from ggplot2 and regression to time series models and cluster computing.

- An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR): <https://www.statlearning.com> great high level survey of some key statistical learning concepts like regression, deep learning, and even survival analysis. Code syntax is sometimes slightly old-fashioned since it uses only base R, with no tidyverse at all, but a great intro nonetheless to some advanced topics.

*more will be added in the future...*
