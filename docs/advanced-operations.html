<p>In this chapter, we will cover a few more advanced, yet incredibly useful data tidying operations like grouping, joining, binding, and pivoting. Along the way, we will also make extensive use of dplyr functions learned in the previous chapter.</p>

</h2>
<p>Often, you will need to apply dplyr’s various operations like <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html">summarize()</a></code>, or slicing function not across the entire dataset but in groups. This is an important technique across data science, whether it’s data cleaning to exploration to visualization to modeling.</p>
<p>By default, data frames are not grouped when created or imported. You can create a grouping structure with the <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">group_by()</a></code> function. The basic syntax is <code>df %&gt;% group_by(col1, col2, ...)</code> where <code>col1</code>, <code>col2</code>, … are variables whose values are used to determine groups. You can group by just 1 variable, 2 variables, or as many variables as needed. <strong>Rows with the same values in the chosen columns will be grouped together</strong>.</p>
<p>After grouping, operations that normally run across all rows <strong>now run across each group</strong>. Here’s a few simple examples using the familiar penguins dataset to start:</p>

<p>Sometimes one <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">group_by()</a></code> may not be enough to get what you need; you may need to re-<code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">group_by()</a></code> by something else to finish the job. For example, suppose you want to see what percent of each species came from different islands. This requires two uses of <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">group_by()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb737"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>This combination of <code>df %&gt;% group_by(...) %&gt;% summarize(n = n())</code> is so common, we have this shortcut for it: <code>df %&gt;% count(...)</code>. We can demonstrate this in another example involving regrouping. Suppose we want to know what percent of each species were male/female:</p>

<p>Many operations output grouped data frames. For example, look closely at the output of the previous chunks and you’ll see <code># Groups:   species [3]</code> in most of them. This means any further operations you run will continue to execute in a grouped way.</p>
<p>You can remove the grouping structure with <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">ungroup()</a></code>. This allows you to revert to running operations on the entire data frame. Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb743"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Let’s give the penguins dataset a rest and practice dplyr and grouping a bit more with a different dataset. The following chunk imports <a href="data/fertility.csv"><code>fertility.csv</code></a>, the cleaned global fertility data set from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN">World Bank</a>, giving the average number of births per woman for each year and country from 1960 to present. For the past few decades, global fertility has been <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/un-population-2024-revision">sharply declining</a> for most countries. Many countries are now below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility">replacement rate of 2.1</a>, leading to widespread concerns of a population collapse in the latter part of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

</h2>
<p>Let’s move on to another topic: merging data frames. Often, the information you need may be spread across several data frames from different samples or different sources, in which case you may need to merge data frames together.</p>
<p>There are generally 2 common ways data may need to be merged: binding rows, and joining columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Binding rows is done when two data frames <strong>share the same columns, but have different rows</strong>, and you want to combine all the rows together.</li>
<li>Joining columns is done when two data frames <strong>share the same rows, but have different columns</strong>, and you want to combine all the columns together.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two are NOT the same, so it’s important to remember which is which.</p>
<div id="binding" class="section level3" number="8.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Binding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#binding"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Binding is the simpler of the two, so let’s start here. Returning briefly to the penguins data set, note there’s a year column which indicates when each sample was collected. This means there were 3 different studies conducted. Suppose each of the years was originally in its own data frame (I suspect this is likely to be true).</p>

<p>We can see our 3 data frames <code>penguins2007</code>, <code>penguins2008</code>, <code>penguins2009</code> share the exact same columns (same number of columns, same column names, same column types) but have different rows. Each data frame can be thought of as containing a fraction of the overall samples or subjects. In this case, we must row-bind the 3 data frames together.</p>
<p>The function <code>bind_rows(df1, df2, ...)</code> lets us do this. Just pass each data frame that needs binding in:</p>

<p>Joining is slightly more complicated. This is for when all the rows are together, but the columns you need are spread out over several data frames. Often, this occurs when you obtain data from different sources and want to combine them to look for patterns, but it can also happen sometimes with multiple data frames gathered from the same source.</p>
<p>Joining is performed by first <strong>matching rows using a set of key variables</strong> before adding in the additional columns. The <strong>key variables should uniquely identify rows</strong>. Here’s a simple demo to start. Suppose you have the following data frames:</p>

<p>Suppose you want to join <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> using column A as the “key”, i.e. “A” is the column that uniquely matches rows across data frames. There are 4 different joins you can use: <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html">inner_join()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html">full_join()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html">left_join()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html">right_join()</a></code> , depending on which rows you want in the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://tavareshugo.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse-gapminder/08-joins/index.html"><img src="joins.svg" class="i6"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>inner_join(x, y)</code> matches rows using key variable(s), then <strong>returns only rows in both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></strong>,</li>
<li>
<code>full_join(x, y)</code> matches rows using key variable(s), then <strong>returns all rows in either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code></strong>,</li>
<li>
<code>left_join(x, y)</code> matches rows using key variable(s), then <strong>returns only rows in <code>x</code></strong>,</li>
<li>
<code>right_join(x, y)</code> matches rows using key variable(s), then <strong>returns only rows in <code>y</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are demos of each join. Note each join has the exact same columns; the only difference is which rows are included in the output. Also note <code>NAs</code> are automatically used to fill in any missing values that arise from the merge.</p>

<p>The above 4 are called the “mutating joins” since they mutate (i.e. change) the data frame by adding additional columns. There are 2 other less commonly used joins called the “filterting joins” called <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html">semi_join()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html">anti_join()</a></code> that do not actually add columns; they are only used to filter rows that match or don’t match another data frame. Examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb788"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># semi_join(x, y) will FILTER rows in x that have matches in y</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># note there are NO new columns added to x</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html">semi_join</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">y</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>

  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb790"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># conversely, anti_join() will FILTER rows in x with NO match in y</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># again, note NO new columns were added to x</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html">anti_join</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">y</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>

1 c         3</code></pre>
<p>These examples only have 1 key column, but the same works if you have 2 or more key columns; rows are matched if they have ALL the same values in the key columns.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>When joining, R will automatically look for columns with the same name to use as key columns. Therefore, to run smoothly, it’s <strong>highly recommended</strong> to ensure the following before joining:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Key columns should have the same name and type.</li>
<li>All other non-key columns should have different names.</li>
<li>When picking a join, carefully consider which rows you will actually need later.</li>
<li>Generally, key values should be unique for each row. If you need to have duplicate key values, watch the joins closely to ensure the join works the way you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s see a real example of joins in action.</p>

<p>The World Bank fertility data set we used earlier obviously didn’t start out perfectly clean and tidy. When you download the CSV file from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN">data page</a> it comes as a zip of the following two (renamed) files: <a href="data/fertility_meta.csv"><code>fertility_meta.csv</code></a> and <a href="data/fertility_raw.csv"><code>fertility_raw.csv</code></a>. One of them contains metadata for each country, while the other contains the actual annual fertility rates.</p>

<p>First, there are several columns like <code>"SpecialNotes"</code>, <code>"Indicator Name"</code>, and <code>"Indicator Code"</code> that we don’t need; we can remove those with <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html">select()</a></code>. Country names are duplicated in both data frames, so we can pick one to use. Let’s pick <code>"TableName"</code> since the names are slightly nicer (check this yourself). The rest of the columns should probably be renamed with <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html">rename()</a></code>.</p>
<p>We can also change the <code>"Low income"</code>, <code>"Lower middle income"</code>, … values into just <code>"Low"</code>, <code>"Lower middle"</code>, … to slightly simplify the column. Shorter labels will also be easier to work with in <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter()</a></code> or in plots.</p>
<p>Note as well the existence of several NAs in region and income. Again, verify this yourself, but these are all further subregion groupings of countries (e.g. AFE and AFW are for Eastern/Southern and Western/Central African countries), so we can simply drop these rows.</p>

<p>Now comes the key step! We’re going to use the <code>"code"</code> columns (which are the 3-letter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1 country codes</a>) as the key columns and join the two data frames together. Let’s use <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html">inner_join()</a></code> to keep only countries that appear in both, since we want to look at region and income group together with fertility rates.</p>
<p>Note these data frames already satisfy the recommended conditions, i.e. the key columns have the same name and type and uniquely identify each country, and all other columns have different names, so there should be no issues.</p>

<p>This already looks pretty good! Our data frames joined nicely along the key <code>"code"</code> column, and now our region, income, and fertility data is in 1 single data frame instead of spread across 2 data frames.</p>
<p>However, you may have noticed we still have a problem: our annual fertility rates are spread out across 63 columns, with each year in its own column. This is not compatible with our tidyverse functions. How do we fix it?</p>

<p>This is where pivoting becomes relevant. Pivoting (also sometimes called reshaping) refers to the process of transforming data between different representations of it. Let’s start with a small example to better illustrate this point.</p>
<p>Suppose two people Alice and Bob are playing a game. They agree to play 3 rounds. Each round, each person tries to score points up to a maximum of 10. The person that wins the most rounds wins overall. Suppose these are the final scores:</p>

<p>Despite the difference in shape and dimensions, the data contained in these data frames is identical. These are often called the <strong>long</strong> and <strong>wide</strong> representations of data, so named because one tends to be longer (i.e. more rows) and the other wider (i.e. more columns). Generally, <strong>long formats are easier to use with R/tidyverse</strong>, whereas <strong>wide formats are easier for humans to read</strong>, but there are of course exceptions to everything.</p>
<p>Usually, for data to be considered “tidy” it needs to be in a longer format. <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org">Tidy data</a> is data that satisfies the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.</li>
<li>Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.</li>
<li>Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Taken from &lt;a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org"&gt;tidyr&lt;/a&gt; home page.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>32</sup></a>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Data in this format will generally be easier to work with using tidyverse, and broadly speaking R, since this format is highly versatile and most functions have been designed to work best on this format.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it should be easy to see that <code>scores_long</code> above satisfies these properties. Each variable is indeed a column (and vice versa), each row an observation (vv.), etc. It should also be evident <code>scores_wide</code> is NOT tidy, since each row actually contains 2 scores, and each column is a person, not a variable (the distinction here is subtle but meaningful).</p>
<p>Tidyr’s <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html">pivot_longer()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html">pivot_wider()</a></code> functions let you easily convert between these two representations. When used correctly, these two should be <strong>inverses of each other</strong>, i.e. you can take a data frame and pivot it longer, then pivot it wider (or vice versa) and get back the original data frame. There are many ways of using these functions (see help page) but here’s a brief guide to their most common and important usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>df %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols, names_to = "..", values_to = "..")</code> turns a “wider” representation into a “longer” representation.
<ul>
<li>
<code>cols</code> is a set of columns where the actual observations are “spread out over”. You can set this using numbers, names, ranges, or selector functions (just like for <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html">select()</a></code>). In the <code>scores_wide</code> data frame, this would be the two columns <code>Alice</code> and <code>Bob</code> since this is where the points for each round are stored.</li>
<li>
<code>names_to</code> sets the name for the new column containing the names of the <code>cols</code>. In the <code>scores_wide</code> data frame, it will be filled with repetitions of <code>"Alice"</code> and <code>"Bob"</code> corresponding to each round’s points.</li>
<li>
<code>values_to</code> sets the name for the new column containing the values inside <code>cols</code>. In the <code>scores_wide</code> data frame, it will be filled with the actual points scored in each round.</li>

<p>Our <code>fertility</code> data set is now 100% fully cleaned and ready for exploration, visualization, and modeling!</p>
<p>Before we move on, let’s demonstrate one more usage for <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html">pivot_wider()</a></code>. This function is also great for making human-friendly summary tables, especially when looking at how 3 variables interrelate. For example, suppose we want to look at, for each region, the percentage of countries in each income group. If we just compute the percentages and print, we get something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb816"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># count how many countries in each region + income group,</span></span>
