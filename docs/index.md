# Welcome {#welcome .unnumbered}


Intro (maybe write this last?)

thins to hit:

- how to use this book
  - book conventions
  - search
  - syntax highlighting
  - auto link of help pages
- view source & edit contributions
- prerequisites
- will not teach everything, just provide foundation for further learning
- acknowledgments for impact of contributions


stuff to add:

- dark mode?
- auto-index generator in _common.R?
- cheatsheet repository
- sample of graded, commentated papers (example of an A, AB, B, BC, C, D, F)
- grade by comparing with reference papers
- conditional stratified sample of papers based on distribution of grades in group
- after paring down samples, ask Derek & Cameron to help with grading evaluation for calibrating papers
- pare down more, use focused sample to calibrate TAs/instructors if needed?
- glossary?


other notes to self:

- use [params](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-declare.html) to control:
  - course directory
  - hw/ds solution generation in files (in separate private repo?)
- build db of past 240 stats
- rethink discord management
