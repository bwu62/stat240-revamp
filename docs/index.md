# Welcome {-}


Intro (maybe write this last?)

things to hit:

- how to use this book
  - book conventions
  - search
  - syntax highlighting
  - auto link of help pages
  - footnotes and other bonus content
  - scope (exclude bonus, extra, links, etc.)
- view source & edit contributions
- prerequisites
- will not teach everything, just provide foundation for further learning
- acknowledgments for impact of contributions


stuff to add:

- dark mode?
- add exercises to each page
- auto-index generator in _common.R?
- cheatsheet repository
- sample of graded, commentated papers (example of an A, AB, B, BC, C, D, F)
- grade by comparing with reference papers
- conditional stratified sample of papers based on distribution of grades in group
- after paring down samples, ask Derek & Cameron to help with grading evaluation for calibrating papers
- pare down more, use focused sample to calibrate TAs/instructors if needed?
- glossary?
- DT datatable fancy printouts?
- basic data literacy concepts?
  - percent of, percent change, X change
  - percent vs points (and point difference)
  - bad plots
  - biases
    - esp. survivorship, selection (e.g. sampling, berkson), generalization (e.g. WEIRD)
  - fallacies
    - prosecutor, gambler, correlation, dredging, regression to mean


dataset ideas (note: should prioritize datasets most students would find interesting)

 - olympics
 - politics
 - crime
 - causes of death
 - climate
 - something economic
 - SSA names
 - birth rate


other notes to self:

- use [params](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-declare.html) to control:
  - course directory
  - hw/ds solution generation in files (in separate private repo?)
- build db of past 240 stats
- rethink discord management
