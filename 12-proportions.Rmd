# Proportions

Let's look specifically at proportions-type inference setups, where we apply a **binomial model** to sample proportions to infer about an underlying **probability** in the population. We will divide this into two scenarios:

 - One-proportion scenario, where there is a single population with a single probability parameter of interest, and
 - Two-proportions scenario, where there are two populations, each with its own probability parameter, which we seek to compare.


:::{.note}
A proportions-type inference approach using a binomial model is **only appropriate** if your sample consists of either 1 or 2 samples where, for each sample, your data looks like **counts across two categories**, one of which we consider "success" and the other "failure" (e.g. heads/tails, true/false, etc.).

In these setups, the probability parameter of the binomial model **always corresponds to the probability of the _success_ category** by convention. Make sure to define the category whose probability is of primary interest as "success".

## One proportion

### Model notation

In the one-proportion scenario, suppose we draw a **fixed sample size of $n$** observations, each of which we model as **independent** and having some constant underlying **true probability $p$ of being a success**, and $1-p$ of being a failure (and there's no other possible outcome).

Let lower-case **$x$ be the observed number of successes in our sample**, and note that we must have $0\le x\le n$. Let $\hat p=x/n$ denote then the **proportion of successes in our sample**.

It's customary to also use upper-case $X$ to represent our model of the true distribution of $x$, which here we choose to be $X\sim\bin(n,p)$.

Under these assumptions, $\hat p$ is a natural **point estimate** for $p$, i.e. our **sample proportion of successes estimates the true underlying probability of success $p$**, since the LLN guarantees $\hat p\to p$ as $n\to\infty$.

:::{.note}
Note several things:

 - $n$ must be a fixed, predetermined sample size,
 - trials must be able to be reasonably modeled as independent,
 - there must only be 2 possible outcomes (success & failure) for each trial,
 - $p$ is always the probability of the "success" category, however it's defined,
 - $x$ usually represents the actual "observed" number of successes in your sample out of $n$ trials,
 - $X$ usually represents the theoretical random variable model we choose to apply to the sample's observed $x$.

```{r d5-rolls,include=F}
# combine 50-roll chunks of data, split, then parse to numeric vector
rolls <- paste0("21252134521555355115322514314333142113433335345333",

rolls
```
```{r,include=F}
n = length(rolls)
x4 = sum(rolls==4)
x5 = sum(rolls==5)
x = sum(rolls>=4)
options(width = 80)
```

Let's see all this in the context of an example. The following are $n=`r n`$ rolls of a purportedly fair 5-sided die I bought online (yes, I really sat in my office and rolled this die `r n` times).

```{r reuse-rolls-chunk,ref.label=I('d5-rolls'),include=T}
```
```{r}
# quick table + plot of results using base R
table(rolls)
```
```{r,eval=F}
barplot(table(rolls))
```

```{r,echo=F}
par(mar=c(2,2,0.5,0),mgp=c(2,.6,0),cex=1.3)
barplot(table(rolls))
```

Suppose my question of interest is whether or not this specific die design does in fact give fair results. There are different ways of testing this^[the most [powerful](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/statistical-power) method is probably a [chi-squared test](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/chi-square-tests).], but a simple way using a proportions-type setup is to ask **whether the two triangular-shaped faces** (which are 4 and 5) **are observed 2/5 or 40% of the time**.

In this setup, we can define "success" as getting 4 or 5, which has theoretical probability $p=0.4$. Our RV model for $X$ where $X$ is the number of successes (4s & 5s) is then $X\sim\bin(n=`r n`,p=0.4)$. In our sample, we observed $x=`r x4`+`r x5`=`r x`$ times this occured, which gives us a sample proportion of $\hat p=x/n=`r x`/`r n`=`r x/n`$.
