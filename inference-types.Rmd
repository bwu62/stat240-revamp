# Inference Types {.unnumbered}

In this next section, we will synthesize everything we've learned thus far about data and probability and see some real world examples of inference in each specific type of data/question that is covered in 240:

 - **Proportions** inference: samples modeled after a binomial distribution, where we use the sample proportion to infer about the underlying probability parameter of the population.

 - **Means** inference: samples modeled after a normal distribution, where we use the sample mean to infer about the underlying mean parameter of the population. This is also where we introduce the t-distribution.

 - **Regression** inference: where we introduce linear regression to model the relationship between two numeric variables.
