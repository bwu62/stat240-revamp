# Data Transformation {.unnumbered}


In this next section, we will learn how to perform some basic data transformation procedures that are commonly used to clean and "tidy" data into a convenient and useful format for whatever purpose it needs to serve. This is loosely broken into several sections.

First, we will learn the basics of [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), another of the core Tidyverse packages, including things like renaming variables, subsetting rows and columns, adding and editing columns, and making summaries.

Then, we will proceed to more advanced topics like grouping operations, combining different data frames along rows and columns, and pivoting using [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), yet another core Tidyverse package.
